          <h2>Insight to Naran Kaghan</h2>

<div class="row">

    <h2>Naran</h2>
    <p>The road to naran valley travells alongside with River Kunhar which Starts from the glaciers of Kaghan and flow deep down in mansehra.  The local languages of Naran Valley are Hindko and Gojri but every individual overthere can speak and understand urdu. The dress is Shalwar kameez with long bottom shalwars. Most of the people are tall. Average height of males was about 5”8’ or 5”9’.</p>
    <p>
     The Inhabitant of Naran Valley are basically Gujars and I found them very generous and good natured. They welcome the tourists very nicely and treats them like their own friends.Their main source of income is the tourists and their occupations include tour guides, resthouse managers, shop keepers, restaurant workers, jeep drivers,  some of them also grow crops and some of them are shepherds. But their whole fortune is just gathered up in the summer season as in winters the whole area is covered up in snow and they have to move down to mansehra or some other hoter place. For that reason the prices over there are bit higher. For example the price of 100 rupee mobile card is about 107 up there. But i think that is fair enough as they this source of income just for limited time.   
    </p>
    <p>
     Naran also has a small bazaar like Murree mall road. The basic necessities of life are readily available at there. Cellular networks, mobile shopes, bakery, general store, tailors and even barbers are available in the main bazar. It has over 100 hotels of various types ranging from high-end luxury hotels to very low priced motels. Tent motels are also present which rent family size tents to tourists to stay in.

    <h2>Kaghan</h2>
    <p>Saifulmalook is is situated 8 kilometers north of Naran. It takes 1 hour to reach saiful malook from Naran. One can find a lot of  4×4 jeeps at the outskirts of town. These jeeps takes the tourists from Naran valley to  Saiful Malook. As the road upthere is very rough and there are glaciers all the way up so only those jeeps and the local drivers can take you up therePeople hire those jeeps and visit Saiful Malook along with their families. Some people prefer trekking over riding the jeep, specialy the youngsters which trek up to Saiful Malook. There are restaurants and shops located at Saiful Malook aswell. People enjoy horse riding at there.</p>
    <p>
      Saiful malook is a lake which is situated in the midle of mountains, which throughout the year are covered with snow.  One of the renowned mountains is Malika Parbat which is placed on the left of the jheel.Saifulmalook is named after a folk tale. It is the story of the prince of Persia who fell in love with a fairy princess at the lake. The impact of the lake beauty is of such extent that people believe that fairies come down to lake in full moon. The colour of water is blue and it is crystal clear.  An individual cannot put his feet under it for more then 30 seconds.
